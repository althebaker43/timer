# Portable Timer Library #

This is a simple project for a timer/counter library that can be easily used on different microcontroller architectures.

## Testing ##

Testing is done using the Unity framework for programs written in C. The Unity distribution used in this project can be obtained from this [source package](http://media.pragprog.com/titles/jgade/code/jgade-code.tgz) ([zip file](http://media.pragprog.com/titles/jgade/code/jgade-code.zip)).

Tests are currently designed to mimic an Atmel AVR microcontroller with several timer modules.
